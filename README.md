# Memories-at-JLU

These are some code I wrote at Jilin University in order to complete some coursework and graduation thesis. The code is simple, but my heart is deep. After graduation, I really miss those days in JLU. Actually I don't know how to express much of my feelings, so creating my first repository to commemorate the four years time.
